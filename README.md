## Installation

To run the project, simply run the file using a live server implementation. Extensions to do this are available in VSCode

## Usage

The Cornell Box simulation has several parameters that can be chosen to tweak the settings and visuals. These include lighting, materials, texture, shadows and several others.
There is also a VR experience with an integrated GUI. However, there are still slight bugs in regards to the file.

## Things to Note
- Due to the large file size of the textures, it may need time to load the website initially
- VR implementation has some issues with the GUI, we recommend changing settings before entering the VR Experience
